,Range: The range gives us the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Variance: The variance measures how much the data points deviate from the mean. It quantifies the average squared difference between each data point and the mean. ,,,,,,
,A higher variance indicates greater variability in the data.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average amount of deviation or dispersion of data points from the mean. ,,,,,,
,A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,IQR (Interquartile Range): The IQR represents the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data. ,,,,,,
,,It captures the spread of the middle 50% of the data. ,,,,,
,,The IQR is particularly useful for identifying outliers and understanding the dispersion within a specific range of values.,,,,,
