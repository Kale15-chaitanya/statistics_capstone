,Range: The range gives us the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Variance: The variance measures how much the data points deviate from the mean. It quantifies the average squared difference between each data point and the mean. ,,,,,,
,A higher variance indicates greater variability in the data.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average amount of deviation or dispersion of data points from the mean. ,,,,,,
,A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,IQR (Interquartile Range): The IQR represents the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data. ,,,,,,
,,It captures the spread of the middle 50% of the data. ,,,,,
,,The IQR is particularly useful for identifying outliers and understanding the dispersion within a specific range of values.,,,,,

,,,,,,,
,Step 5) Presentation of results,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,AS shown Above,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Step 6) Formulation of conclusions,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,How can we boost performance by location?,,,,,
,Bangalore,,,,,,
,>Bangalore has a relatively lower total sales compared to Delhi.,,,,,,
,">The number of sales in Bangalore is also lower, indicating a lower transaction volume.",,,,,,
,">However, the average price per apartment in Bangalore is higher than Delhi and Mumbai, suggesting higher property values in the area.",,,,,,
,>The average area indicates larger-sized apartments compared to Delhi and Mumbai.,,,,,,
,>The average price per sq m indicates a higher pricing range for properties in the location.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"For Bangalore, we would need further analysis as evident by its larger spread. ",,,,,,
,There seems to be an outlier (refer to the last row of the original data where the apartment has an area of 532 sq m and is quite expensive).,,,,,,
,Actionable insights: We need some input from the sales team to understand whether or not the outlier case is a true representation of Bangalore prices because ,,,,,,
,it seems to be an anomaly as compared to other apartment data. If it is not a typical regular case then we should definitely not factor this in our location-based ,,,,,,
,analysis of Bangalore apartments. (It would make sense to conduct analysis without considering this outlier or at least understand from the sales team if ,,,,,,
,in the past they have sold more apartments of a larger size.),,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"However, on the basis of our current analysis, we can suggest one possible insight for improving apartment sales performance in Bangalore: To focus on",,,,,,
,"marketing the benefits of larger and more valuable properties in the area. Compared to Delhi and Mumbai, (once confirmed by the sales team, you can",,,,,,
,note that) Bangalore offers more spacious and premium apartments that can appeal to buyers who are looking for comfort and quality. A targeted,,,,,,
,"campaign that showcases the features and amenities of the apartments, as well as the advantages of living in Bangalore, could help increase the",,,,,,
,demand and transaction volume in the location.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Delhi,,,,,,
,">Delhi has the highest total sales among the three locations, indicating strong sales performance.",,,,,,
,">The number of sales in Delhi is also higher, reflecting a higher transaction volume.",,,,,,
,>The average price per apartment is relatively lower than Bangalore but higher than Mumbai.,,,,,,
,>The average area indicates a moderate apartment size.,,,,,,
,>The average price per sq m in Delhi suggests a reasonable pricing range for properties in the location,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Actionable insights: The sales team seems to be in a good position for Delhi-based apartments. We have the highest sales and number of apartments,,,,,,
,"sold compared to the other locations. To enhance the sales even more, perhaps the team can try to sell more spacious apartments as currently the",,,,,,
,average area indicates a moderate apartment size.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"In addition, they can focus on increasing the average price per apartment by offering more premium features or amenities. This could help to attract",,,,,,
,"more high-end buyers who are willing to pay more for larger or better-equipped apartments. Alternatively, another insight is to target more first-time",,,,,,
,buyers or renters who are looking for affordable and convenient apartments in a prime location.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,Mumbai,,,,,,
,>Mumbai has a lower total sales figure compared to Delhi and Bangalore.,,,,,,
,">The number of sales in Mumbai is relatively moderate, indicating a fairly decent transaction volume.",,,,,,
,>The average price per apartment seems lower than both Delhi and Bangalore.,,,,,,
,>The average area suggests a moderately smaller apartment size.,,,,,,
,>The average price per sq m indicates a lower pricing range for properties in the location.,,,,,,
,>We would recommend further analysis as the spread of the middle range of apartments is more diverse in Mumbai as compared to the other cities.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"Actionable insights: More analysis by the sales team, especially in the middle range of apartments, is definitely worth looking into by the sales team.",,,,,,
,This spread may indicate that it is not a true representation of prices.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"Nonetheless, one possible insight for improving the sales performance of Mumbai apartments is to focus on increasing the transaction volume by",,,,,,
,"targeting buyers who are looking for affordable and moderately sized properties in the city. This could be done by offering attractive financing options,",,,,,,
,"discounts, or incentives to potential customers, as well as by marketing the benefits of living in Mumbai, such as its cultural diversity, economic",,,,,,
,"opportunities, and connectivity. By increasing the demand and sales volume, the average price per apartment and per sq m could also rise over time,",,,,,,
,leading to higher revenue and profitability for the sales team.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,What insights do you have for the sales agents?,,,,,,
,"For the most part, agents in Delhi and agents in Mumbai seem to be working at par with their own teammates. However, the number of apartments sold",,,,,,
,in Mumbai by each sales agent seems lower than that of Delhi based agents. Perhaps it would make sense for the Delhi team to communicate their,,,,,,
,sales approach to the Mumbai team so that Mumbai sales grows.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,"Most importantly, the Bangalore sales division has some interesting insights.",,,,,,
,"    #Agent_Id 17 seems to have sold the most expensive apartment, which as we assessed, could be an anomaly.",,,,,,
,,>The sales team could get more insights from this agent on what the customer demographic was that ,,,,,
,,bought the apartment and how they convinced the customer to buy the apartment.,,,,,
,,">Then, using that information, sales agents could sell more premium apartments.",,,,,
,    #The number of sold apartments seems to be very low - almost all the agents sold only one apartment!,,,,,,
,,-The sales team needs to figure out how to boost morale or motivate the agents such as:,,,,,
,,  >Setting clear and realistic expectations for each agent,,,,,
,,  >Offering incentives/rewards for meeting sales targets,,,,,
,,  >Providing regular feedback as well as encouraging the team to collaborate,,,,,
,    #Agent_Id 16 also seems to be an outlier value as they sold the most number of apartments.,,,,,,
,,">This agent seems like a great candidate to be promoted as a team leader for the Bangalore sales division, so that they can guide the other",,,,,
,,agents and help boost their sales count.,,,,,
